# MY Way -Learn in your way  
AI based learning Platform


Every Student is unique and has its own way of Learning , which a traditional Education System can’t provide. The abundant amount of resources leave a student flabbergasted and confused and the lack of proper guidance leads to spending time and money on wrong resources .

To solve these issues, we propose our AI powered project “MyWay” which is a one platform solution.

MyWay is a one-stop solution to many virtual mentoring-based models.

MyWay is completely based on Virtual Mentor for Student Learning and GenAI.


# OUR SUBMISSION
To solve the issues, we have created a website with these models.

1.Roadmap generator

2.Student performance predictor

3.Ai topic Discussion (crew AI)

4 AI senior chatbot

5.Chat with Document

Each model tries to solve a major issue a student face in this education system.


# CONSEQUENCE
1.Right guidance : our model would be able to impact the confused students and save resources,money and time .

2.NO Distraction : this model would be able to provide a platform without any distractions which leads to a productive output.

3.Different Student — Different Learning : we believe that every student is different and every student has its own way of learning. So this model can be used to provide the right pathway and customize the material.Wow Factor

This has some potential impact towards the education system and curriculum.

And some are listed below :-

1)Enhanced Learning Outcomes:- The model would empower students to take ownership of their learning journey by providing tailored support and resources.

2)Increased Engagement :- Interactive features and personalized feedback would foster greater engagement and enthusiasm for learning.

3)Scalability :- The model could be scaled to serve diverse student populations, bridging gaps in educational access and support.

4)70 20 10 Learning Theory:- The model present the resources on the base of 70 20 10 Learning Theory which works to bring the best outcome
